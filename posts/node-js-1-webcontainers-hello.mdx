### Nodejs-1: Webcontainers Initial Setup 

In this tutorial, we will introduce you to WebContainers and show you how to run your first Node.js application within a browser environment. WebContainers allow you to create full-stack Node.js environments that run entirely in your browser, providing a seamless development experience.

To get started, we will run a simple Node.js application that prints a message to the console. Open the terminal in the right section and enter the following command:

```sh
console.log("Hello from webcontainers")
```

After running the command, you should see the message "Hello from webcontainers" printed in the console. This demonstrates the power and convenience of using WebContainers for your Node.js development.

Now let's go deeper and create a express server using WebContainers.

#### Creating an Express Server  

To create an Express server using WebContainers, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```sh
mkdir express-server
cd express-server
```

2. Create npm project

```sh
npm init -y
```

3. Install Express:

```sh
npm install express
```

4. Create a new file named `index.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express Server!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

5. Run the server using the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

After running the command, you should see the message "Server running at http://localhost:3000" printed in the console. You can now access your Express server by calling from terminal using curl:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the message "Hello from Express Server!" displayed in the terminal. This demonstrates how easy it is to create and run an Express server using WebContainers.

And also it automatically opens the browser with the output.  

Nice work 👏🏻.
