# yazgan.xyz - Personal Website

This is my digital garden entrypoint. I will be sharing my thoughts, projects, and other stuff here.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploying

This is sveltekit static website so you can deploy it to any static hosting service. I am using Github pages for this project.

```bash
#Â after development. Just push code into master branch to deploy
git add .
git commit -m "v1.0.0: Initial release"
git push origin master
```

## UI

You can preview the production build at link below:
